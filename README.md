# SUSY Searches

SUSY searches using Machine Learning Techniques. The following ML techniques were used in the study:

1. XGBClassifier (from XGBoost)
2. Deep Neural Network
3. Variational Autoencoder (work still in progress)
4. (To Do) Autoencoder

These ML techniques were trained using low-level features, high-level features and combination of both low-level and high level features.
